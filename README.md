If you want to use a CSS library in your project. The simplest way to do that is to find a CDN link to it and add that to your <head> tag in the layout.erb file.

```
<link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^1.0/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

If you want to check what a style does, you can search for the class here:
```
https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@1.6.2/dist/tailwind.css
```
and see what css styles are applied to elements that have that class.
